Will you be able to help Lizard Gemo to get to the other side?

This is the demo version of the game with 2 levels. 

Gemo(player) can move, jump, aim and shoot bullets to kill enemies or gain hearts, and mostly importantly, it can morph into different colors. The lands(platforms) have foru different color that Gemo need to morph in correspondence to avoid damage.

control:
A,D - move
space - jump
mouse and left click - aim and shoot
EQFR - change color (green, blue, purple, red)

The player starts with 4 hearts and can collect hearts as it navigates.

This is a original 2D platformer with an exiting twist (built with unity). More updates later.
