# Lizard Gemo - A Supposedlly 4-Hand Game (Play with Friends!)
Will you be able to help Lizard Gemo to get to the other side?
This is a original 2D platformer with an exiting twist (built with unity). More updates later (maybe never).


This is the demo version and may stay at Demo Version forever.

## Dev Notes
This is my first complete (lol) game. I hope you and the future me will take it lightly because I am still a noob and are still learning, every day. I hope I can keep on developing and I am excited for more projects to come!
